/* Sovereigns act as leader units. They will attempt to form a squad when there is nearby unassigned combat units. When a sovereign dies, its followers will continue fighting untill victory or death,
until which it will await around for a new sovereign to take command. Sovereigns tend to be primarly non-combat units, taking movement and survivability over damage in order to coordinate nearby
units. It often sits at the back of the fight, avoiding direct confrontation. */
